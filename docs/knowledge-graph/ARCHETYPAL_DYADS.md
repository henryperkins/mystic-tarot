# Archetypal Dyads - Data Structure Specification

## Overview

Archetypal Dyads are powerful two-card combinations that create synergistic meaning beyond their individual interpretations. When these specific pairs appear together in a spread, they tell a recognizable story or highlight a particular dynamic that professional readers consistently observe.

## Current Implementation

The codebase already detects 5 dyads in `src/lib/deck.js:computeRelationships()`:

```javascript
const pairings = [
  { cards: ['The Fool', 'The Magician'], desc: 'New beginnings (Fool) empowered by manifesting ability (Magician).' },
  { cards: ['Death', 'The Star'], desc: 'Transformation (Death) leading to hope and renewal (Star).' },
  { cards: ['The Tower', 'The Sun'], desc: 'Upheaval (Tower) clearing the path to joy and clarity (Sun).' },
  { cards: ['The Devil', 'The Lovers'], desc: 'Attachment patterns (Devil) affecting relationship choices (Lovers).' },
  { cards: ['The Hermit', 'The High Priestess'], desc: 'Deep introspection (Hermit) accessing inner wisdom (High Priestess).' }
];
```

This document extends that foundation with richer metadata and additional dyads.

## Design Principles

### What Makes a Valid Dyad

1. **Synergistic Meaning:** The pair together means more than the sum of individual cards
2. **Professional Recognition:** Experienced readers recognize this combination as significant
3. **Clear Dynamic:** The relationship between the cards is intuitive and meaningful
4. **Flexible Context:** Works across different spread positions and question types

### Dyad Categories

**Transformation Dyads:** Cards that mark shift from one state to another
**Amplification Dyads:** Cards that intensify each other's energy
**Tension Dyads:** Cards that create productive friction
**Support Dyads:** Cards that harmonize and strengthen
**Caution Dyads:** Cards that signal challenge or warning

## Usage Guidelines

### Priority in Readings

1. **Complete Triads** (highest)
2. **High-significance dyads** (Death+Star, Tower+Sun, Fool+Magician, Devil+Lovers)
3. **Medium-high dyads**
4. **Medium dyads** (mention if space permits)

### Narrative Integration

**Strong Dyad (high significance):**
> "{Card1} and {Card2} create a powerful {category} dyad: {narrative template with card contexts}."

**Supporting Dyad (medium significance):**
> "Note also {Card1} and {Card2}: {brief narrative}."

### Don't Overwhelm

- Maximum 2-3 dyad mentions per reading
- Prioritize complete triads over dyads
- Choose dyads most relevant to the question
