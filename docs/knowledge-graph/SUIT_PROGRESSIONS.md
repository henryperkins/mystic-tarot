# Suit Progressions - Data Structure Specification

## Overview

Each Minor Arcana suit (Wands, Cups, Swords, Pentacles) tells a complete narrative story from Ace (pure potential) through Ten (culmination). These progressions follow consistent patterns across suits, representing the journey of that suit's element through three developmental stages.

## Traditional Foundation

Suit progressions are based on:
- **Rachel Pollack's** three-stage structure (Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom)
- **Golden Dawn** esoteric correspondences
- **Kabbalistic numerology** (Aces as Kether, Tens as Malkuth)
- **Professional reading practice** (observing narrative patterns)

## Universal Three-Stage Structure

Each suit divides into three acts following a developmental arc:

### **Beginning (Ace-2-3):** Initiation
- Ace: Pure elemental energy, gift, potential
- Two: Choice, duality, initial relationship
- Three: First manifestation, expansion, expression

### **Challenge (4-5-6-7):** Testing
- Four: Foundation or stagnation (depends on suit)
- Five: Conflict, struggle, disruption
- Six: Resolution, healing, movement
- Seven: Pause for assessment or strategic choice

### **Mastery (8-9-10):** Culmination
- Eight: Power, movement, or skill (depends on suit)
- Nine: Near-completion, wish or burden
- Ten: Full culmination (blessing or exhaustion)

## Detection Logic

```javascript
function detectSuitProgressions(cards) {
  const minorCards = cards.filter(c => c.suit && c.rankValue);
  if (minorCards.length < 2) return null;

  const detected = [];

  // Group cards by suit
  const bySuit = minorCards.reduce((acc, card) => {
    if (!acc[card.suit]) acc[card.suit] = [];
    acc[card.suit].push(card);
    return acc;
  }, {});

  // Analyze each suit
  Object.entries(bySuit).forEach(([suit, suitCards]) => {
    if (suitCards.length < 2) return;

    const progression = SUIT_PROGRESSIONS[suit];
    if (!progression) return;

    const ranks = suitCards.map(c => c.rankValue).sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Check which stage(s) are represented
    const stages = { beginning: [], challenge: [], mastery: [] };

```

## Narrative Templates

### Strong Progression (3+ cards from one stage)
> "**{Suit} {Stage}:** {Theme}. With {card list}, you're clearly in the {stage description} phase of this suit's journey. {Narrative arc}."

**Example:**
> "**Wands Beginning:** Ignition. With Ace, Two, and Three of Wands all present, you're clearly in the ignition phase—pure creative spark being channeled into strategic planning, now expanding into confident momentum. The fire is lit and growing."

### Emerging Progression (2 cards from one stage)
> "**{Suit} {Stage} (emerging):** {Card1} and {Card2} suggest {brief narrative}."

**Example:**
> "**Cups Challenge (emerging):** Five and Six of Cups suggest movement from grief toward healing nostalgia—you're processing loss while reconnecting with what remains sweet."

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Surface

**Highest Priority:** Strong progressions (3+ cards from one suit in one stage)
- Name the suit and stage explicitly
- Explain the narrative arc
- 2-3 sentences

**Medium Priority:** Emerging progressions (2 cards)
- Brief mention
- 1 sentence

**Low Priority:** Scattered minor cards
- Don't force progression narrative
- Focus on individual meanings

### Integration with Other Patterns

- **With Fool's Journey:** Suit progression = practical arc; Journey = archetypal arc
- **With Triads:** Triads take priority if Major Arcana
- **With Numerical Harmonics:** If multiple suits share same rank, note the harmonic
