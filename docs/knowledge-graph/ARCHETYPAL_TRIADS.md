# Archetypal Triads - Data Structure Specification

## Overview

Archetypal Triads are powerful three-card combinations that form complete narrative arcs. When these cards appear together in a spread, they create a synergy greater than the sum of their parts—telling a specific, recognizable story of transformation, growth, or challenge.

## Traditional Foundation

Triads are based on:
- **Sequential narrative logic** in the Major Arcana
- **Thematic resonance** across cards
- **Professional reading practice** (common patterns readers recognize)
- **Psychological transformation arcs** (crisis → process → resolution)

## Core Principles

### What Makes a Valid Triad

1. **Narrative Coherence:** The three cards tell a clear story with beginning → middle → end
2. **Transformational Arc:** There's a journey from one state to another
3. **Resonant Meaning:** Professional readers recognize this combination as significant
4. **Position Independence:** The pattern holds meaning regardless of spread positions

### Triad Structure

Each triad includes:
- **Complete form:** All 3 cards present (highest significance)
- **Partial forms:** Any 2 of the 3 cards (supporting significance)
- **Narrative template:** Story the complete triad tells
- **Partial narratives:** Stories when only 2/3 cards appear

## The Five Core Triads

### 1. The Healing Arc
**Cards:** Death (13) → Temperance (14) → The Star (17)
**Theme:** Transformation through Integration to Renewal

**Complete Narrative:**
"The classic healing journey. Death (13) marks a necessary ending—something in your life must be released. Temperance (14) is the alchemical middle space where you integrate the loss, finding new balance through patient, gentle work. The Star (17) is renewed hope emerging—you've weathered the storm and can now see guiding light. This is the arc of authentic healing: ending → integration → rebirth."

**Why This Works:**
- Death initiates transformation
- Temperance is the healing process itself (alchemy, integration)
- Star is the result: hope restored after darkness

**Partial Narratives:**
- **Death + Temperance:** "Transformation actively seeking balance; you're in the integration phase of a major ending."
- **Temperance + Star:** "Patient alchemical work leading to renewed hope; the healing process is bearing fruit."
- **Death + Star:** "Dramatic shift from ending to rebirth, though you may be skipping the slow integration work that Temperance offers."

**Reading Context:**
- **Grief work:** Literal healing from loss
- **Life transitions:** Career change, relationship ending, identity shift
- **Shadow integration:** Releasing old patterns, integrating new self

**Significance Levels:**
- Complete (all 3): "major" — Explicitly name as The Healing Arc
- Partial (2/3): "supporting" — Mention the partial connection

### 2. The Liberation Arc
**Cards:** The Devil (15) → The Tower (16) → The Sun (19)
**Theme:** From Bondage through Destruction to Freedom

**Complete Narrative:**
"The arc of breaking free. The Devil (15) names the chains—addiction, limiting beliefs, toxic attachment, materialism. You're aware of bondage but may feel powerless. The Tower (16) is the necessary disruption that breaks those chains—often sudden, uncomfortable, but ultimately liberating. The Sun (19) is the joy and clarity that emerge when you're finally free. This triad says: what's falling apart needed to fall apart so you could reclaim your authentic self."

**Why This Works:**
- Devil = recognizing what binds you
- Tower = the breakdown that frees you
- Sun = the joy of liberation, authentic self restored

**Partial Narratives:**
- **Devil + Tower:** "Attachments meeting necessary disruption; the chains are breaking whether you're ready or not."
- **Tower + Sun:** "Upheaval clearing the path to clarity and joy; what's collapsing reveals the truth."
- **Devil + Sun:** "From shadow bondage to radiant freedom, though the Tower's rupture happens swiftly rather than gradually."

**Reading Context:**
- **Addiction recovery:** Literal or metaphorical
- **Toxic relationships:** Recognizing bondage, experiencing rupture, finding freedom
- **Career change:** Leaving what no longer serves
- **Spiritual awakening:** Breaking from limiting dogma

**Significance Levels:**
- Complete: "major" — Name as Liberation Arc
- Partial: "supporting" — Acknowledge the transition energy

### 3. The Inner Work Arc
**Cards:** The Hermit (9) → The Hanged Man (12) → The Moon (18)
**Theme:** Solitude through Surrender into Deep Mystery

**Complete Narrative:**
"The contemplative path. The Hermit (9) withdraws from the outer world to seek inner wisdom—solitary reflection, meditation, study. The Hanged Man (12) deepens this by asking you to surrender, to stop trying to figure it out, and simply hang in the mystery. The Moon (18) is where this leads: the deep unconscious, dream realm, shadow work, intuitive knowing that transcends logic. This triad describes profound inner work that can't be rushed."

**Why This Works:**
- Hermit = intentional solitude for wisdom
- Hanged Man = surrendering the need to control or understand
- Moon = diving into the unconscious, embracing mystery

**Partial Narratives:**
- **Hermit + Hanged Man:** "Introspection leading to necessary pause; solitude demands you stop striving."
- **Hanged Man + Moon:** "Surrender opening to the shadow realm; letting go reveals hidden depths."
- **Hermit + Moon:** "Solo journey into the unconscious; withdrawal for deep psychospiritual work."

**Reading Context:**
- **Spiritual practice:** Meditation, dreamwork, shadow integration
- **Therapy/inner work:** Deep psychological processing
- **Creative incubation:** Allowing ideas to gestate without forcing
- **Grief:** The quiet, internal work of mourning

**Significance Levels:**
- Complete: "major" — The Inner Work Arc (emphasize patience)
- Partial: "supporting" — Acknowledge contemplative energy

### 4. The Mastery Arc
**Cards:** The Magician (1) → The Chariot (7) → The World (21)
**Theme:** Skill through Directed Action to Complete Achievement

**Complete Narrative:**
"The path of manifestation and mastery. The Magician (1) marshals all resources ('as above, so below')—you have the tools and the knowledge. The Chariot (7) is disciplined, focused action: willpower channeled toward a clear goal. The World (21) is the fruition: complete achievement, integration, mastery. This triad says: you know what to do (Magician), you're doing it with focus (Chariot), and you're reaching completion (World)."

**Why This Works:**
- Magician = potential + skill + resources
- Chariot = directed willpower in action
- World = culmination, success, integration

**Partial Narratives:**
- **Magician + Chariot:** "Potential directed into decisive movement; skill meeting disciplined action."
- **Chariot + World:** "Determined effort reaching culmination; victory is near."
- **Magician + World:** "From first spark to full realization; the journey of bringing vision into form."

**Reading Context:**
- **Career goals:** Building expertise, achieving success
- **Creative projects:** From concept to completion
- **Personal development:** Mastering new skills, reaching milestones
- **Manifestation work:** Consciously creating desired outcomes

**Significance Levels:**
- Complete: "major" — The Mastery Arc (celebrate progress)
- Partial: "supporting" — Acknowledge forward momentum

### 5. The Relationship & Values Arc
**Cards:** The Empress (3) → The Lovers (6) → The Hierophant (5)
**Theme:** Abundance through Choice to Commitment

**Complete Narrative:**
"The arc of examining what you value. The Empress (3) is abundance, sensory pleasure, creative fertility—life offering you richness. The Lovers (6) is the choice point: among these abundant options, what aligns with your deepest values? What do you choose? The Hierophant (5) is commitment to something larger than yourself—tradition, teaching, spiritual path, or formal bond. This triad asks: What do you value enough to commit to?"

**Why This Works:**
- Empress = abundance, many options, sensory richness
- Lovers = choosing based on values alignment
- Hierophant = committing to the chosen path, honoring tradition or teaching

**Partial Narratives:**
- **Empress + Lovers:** "Creative fertility meeting decisive choice; abundance requires discernment."
- **Lovers + Hierophant:** "Personal values versus collective tradition; choosing what's sacred to you."
- **Empress + Hierophant:** "Nurturing energy seeking formal structure; abundance wants form."

**Reading Context:**
- **Romantic relationships:** From attraction to commitment
- **Creative work:** From inspiration to disciplined practice
- **Spiritual path:** From exploration to choosing a tradition
- **Values clarification:** What matters enough to commit to?

**Significance Levels:**
- Complete: "major" — Values & Commitment Arc
- Partial: "supporting" — Note choice/commitment themes

## Detection Logic

```javascript
function detectArchetypalTriads(cards) {
  const numbers = cards
    .filter(c => c.number >= 0 && c.number <= 21)
    .map(c => c.number);

  const detected = [];

  ARCHETYPAL_TRIADS.forEach(triad => {
    const matches = triad.cards.filter(num => numbers.includes(num));

    if (matches.length >= 2) {
      const completeness = matches.length / triad.cards.length;
      const isComplete = matches.length === 3;

      // Generate narrative based on which cards are present
      let narrative = triad.narrative;
      if (!isComplete) {
        const pairKey = matches.map(n =>
          triad.names[triad.cards.indexOf(n)].toLowerCase().replace(/^the /, '')
        ).join('-');
        narrative = triad.partialNarrative[pairKey] || triad.description;
      }

      detected.push({
        id: triad.id,
        theme: triad.theme,
        matchedCards: matches,
        matchedNames: matches.map(n => triad.names[triad.cards.indexOf(n)]),
        completeness: completeness * 100,
        isComplete,
        narrative,
        fullDescription: triad.description,
        significance: isComplete ? 'complete-triad' : 'partial-triad',
        strength: isComplete ? 'major' : 'supporting'
      });
    }
  });

  // Sort by completeness (complete triads first)
  return detected.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.isComplete !== b.isComplete) return a.isComplete ? -1 : 1;
    return b.matchedCards.length - a.matchedCards.length;
  });
}
```

## Narrative Templates

### Complete Triad (All 3 cards)
> "**{Theme}:** {Card1}, {Card2}, and {Card3} form a complete narrative arc. {Complete narrative}. This is a significant pattern showing {thematic insight}."

**Example:**
> "**The Healing Arc:** Death, Temperance, and The Star form a complete narrative arc. This is the classic healing journey—Death marks a necessary ending, Temperance is the alchemical integration work, and The Star is renewed hope emerging. You're moving through authentic transformation, not bypassing the grief or rushing to false positivity."

### Partial Triad (2 of 3 cards)
> "**{Theme} (partial):** {Card1} and {Card2} suggest {partial narrative}."

**Example:**
> "**The Healing Arc (partial):** Death and The Star suggest a dramatic shift from ending to rebirth. While Temperance (the middle card of this pattern) isn't present, the arc from release to renewal is clear—though you may be moving quickly through integration rather than lingering in that alchemical middle space."

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Surface

**Highest Priority:** Complete triads (all 3 cards)
- Name the arc explicitly
- Explain the full narrative
- Dedicate 2-3 sentences to this pattern

**Medium Priority:** Partial triads (2 of 3 cards)
- Mention briefly
- Name what's missing
- 1-2 sentences

**Low Priority:** Multiple partial triads
- Choose the most relevant to the question
- Don't overwhelm the reading with pattern lists

### Integration with Other Elements

- **With Fool's Journey:** Triad provides specific story; Journey provides developmental context
- **With Elemental Dignities:** Triad is thematic; elements are relational dynamics
- **With Reversal Framework:** Apply reversal lens to individual cards within the triad

## Validation Rules

### What NOT to Do

❌ Don't force triads when cards aren't present
❌ Don't invent new triads without traditional resonance
❌ Don't let triads overshadow position meanings
❌ Don't mix triads in confusing ways (pick the strongest one)

### Quality Checks

✅ Does the complete triad narrative make intuitive sense?
✅ Do the partial narratives feel meaningful (not forced)?
✅ Would a professional reader recognize this combination?
✅ Does it enhance rather than overwhelm the reading?
